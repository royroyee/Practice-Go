### `defer session.Close()`
The line defer session.Close() is used to ensure that the session is properly closed when the program exits. The defer keyword in Go is used to defer the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. In this case, session.Close() is being deferred until the end of the main function. This means that the session will be closed automatically when the main function returns, regardless of whether it returns normally or due to a panic.

Closing the session is important to release any resources that were allocated during the session, such as network connections and memory. Failing to close a session can result in resource leaks, which can cause performance problems and eventually lead to exhaustion of system resources. By using defer session.Close(), you can ensure that the session is always closed properly, even if an error occurs in the main function or if the program exits early due to a panic.
